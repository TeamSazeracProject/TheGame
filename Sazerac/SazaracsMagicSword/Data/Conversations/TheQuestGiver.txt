You see a man who looks troulbled.
He's waving at people to come and listen to him, but nobody stops by.
...except you...
Quest Giver: Greetings, My friend. Are you looking for a quest, perchance?
You: Mayhap. What do you offer?
Quest Giver: I need you to collect 5 yellow ants from the shores of Mahmar sea.
You: What!? That place is 5 days away by horse! And it's creeping with evil demons!
Quest Giver: I really need those ants.
You: Look. I'm sorry. This game doesn't have a quest system yet.
It's imposible for me to take on your request.
Quest Giver: Yeah, right. Like I'll bite that!
You decide to leave the men alone. Let him find someone else to trouble."
