This d-cument describes the team w-rk assignment f-r Telerik Academy students studying -bject--riented Pr-gramming (--P) – February 2014.

Pr-ject Descripti-n
Design and implement an -bject--riented R-le Playing Game by ch-ice. Here are s-me suggesti-ns:
  -	The w-rld can be fantasy, sci-fi, m-dern, etc.
  -	Y-u may have -ne -r m-re her-es, gaining experience, having skills, wearing items, etc.
  -	Y-u may have -ne -r m-re players, fighting against a c-mputer -r against each -ther
  -	Y-u may haveenemieslike creatures, machines, warri-rs, etc. 
  -	Y-u may have items like sw-rds, guns, arm-r, space-suits, etc.
  -	Y-u may have skillslike d-uble-damage, telep-rtati-n, etc.

General Requirements
Please define and implement the f-ll-wing -bject--riented assets in y-ur pr-ject:
  -	At least 5 interfaces (with -ne -r m-re implementati-ns)
  -	At least 15 classes (implementing the applicati-n l-gic)
  -	At least 3 abstract class (with inherit-rs)
  -	At least 1 excepti-n class (with usage in y-ur c-de)
  -	At least 3 levels -f depth in inheritance
  -	At least 1 p-lym-rphism usage
  -	At least 1 structure
  -	At least 1 enumerati-n
  -	At least 1 event (with subscribers)
  -	At least 1 design pattern (e.g. C-mp-site, Singlet-n, Fact-ry, Wrapper, Bridge, C-mmand, Iterat-r, …)
Y-u might read ab-ut design patterns in Wikipedia, S-urcemaking, D-Fact-ryand -thers.

Additi-nal Requirements
  -	F-ll-w the best practices f-r -- design: use data encapsulati-n, use excepti-n handling pr-perly, use delegates and events like it is rec-mmended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstracti-n and p-lym-rphismpr-perly, f-ll-w the principles -f str-ng c-hesi-n and l--se c-upling.
  -	-bligat-ry use Git t- keep y-ur s-urce c-de and f-r team c-llab-rati-n (y-u might use https://github.c-m/). TFS -r SVN are n-t all-wed. Use Git.
  -	Pr-vide a class diagram (t- visualize all types).

-pti-nal Requirements
If y-u have a chance, time and a suitable situati-n, y-u might add s-me -f the f-ll-wing t- y-ur pr-ject:
  -	Static members (fields, pr-perties, c-nstruct-r, etc.)
  -	C-nstants, generic types, indexers, -perat-rs
  -	Lambda expressi-ns and LINQ
  -	Implementati-n -f IEnumerable<T>, ICl-neable, T-String() -verride
  -	Namespaces (if y-ur classes are t-- much)
  -	User interface (UI) – c-ns-le, graphical, web -r m-bile

N-n-Required W-rk
  -	C-mpletely finished pr-ject is n-t -bligat-ry required. It will n-t be a big pr-blem if y-ur pr-ject is n-t c-mpletely finished -r is n-t w-rking greatly. This team w-rk pr-ject is f-r educati-nal purp-se. Its main purp-se it t- experience -bject--riented m-deling and --P in a real-w-rld pr-ject and t- get s-me experience in team w-rking and team c-llab-rati-n with Git. 

Deliverables
Put the f-ll-wing in a ZIP archive and submit it (each team member submits the same file):
  -	The c-mplete s-urce c-de.
  -	Brief d-cumentati-n -f y-ur pr-ject (2-3 pages). It sh-uld pr-vide the f-ll-wing inf-rmati-n (in brief):
    -	Team name and list -f team members
    -	Pr-ject purp-se – what pr-blem d- y-u s-lve?
    -	Class diagram -f y-ur types
    -	The URL -f y-ur Git rep-sit-ry
    -	Any -ther inf-rmati-n (-pti-nally)
  -	-pti-nally pr-vide a P-werP-int presentati-n designed f-r the pr-ject defense.

Public Pr-ject Defense
Each team will have t- deliver a public defense -f its w-rk in fr-m -f the -ther students and trainers. Y-u will have -nly 10 minutes f-r the f-ll-wing:
  -	Dem-nstrate the applicati-n (very sh-rtly).
  -	Sh-w the class diagram (just a glance).
  -	Sh-w the s-urce c-de in the Git web-based s-urce c-de br-wser.
  -	Sh-w the c-mmits l-gs t- c-nfirm th-se team members wh- have c-ntributed.
  -	-pti-nally y-u might prepare a P-werP-int presentati-n (3-4 slides).
Please be strict in timing! Be well prepared f-r presenting maximum -f y-ur w-rk f-r minimum time.Bring y-ur -wn lapt-p. Test it preliminary with the multimedia pr-ject-r. -pen the pr-ject assets bef-rehand t- save time.Y-u have 10 minutes, n- m-re.
Give Feedback ab-ut Y-ur Teammates
Y-u will be invited t- pr-vide feedback ab-ut all y-ur teammates, their attitude t- this pr-ject, their technical skills, their team w-rking skills, their c-ntributi-n t- the pr-ject, etc. The feedback is imp-rtant part -f the pr-ject evaluati-n s- take it seri-usly and be h-nest.
