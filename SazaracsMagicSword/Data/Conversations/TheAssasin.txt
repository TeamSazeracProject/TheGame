You see a shady person, and your wallet in his hand. 
When did he manage to take it from you?
He's not just a thief however. He's an assassin,
..and his tools of trade are an arcenal of hidden weapons.
The Assassin: Need some help, with them enemies, syre?
You: I don't have any money, since you took them from me.
The Assassin: You call 'this' money? 
If so, then I guess you can not afford to use my help.
You: But why did the developers place you here, if I can not possibly hire you?
The Assassin: Maybe they wanted me to kill you? Did you anger then somehow?
You: No, this can't be it. They are not like that. They are nice guys.
The Assassin: Then why don't you have any money?
You: Because...
The Assassin: I think what they wanted to do is to make fun of you
...by putting you next to someone like me.
The Assassin: You get it? They put a professional loser next to proffesional killer.
The Assassin: You must've really pissed them off somehow.
You leave him alone and start crying like a little girl.
