You see a muscular smith at his workplace.
He's quite busy, but he stops to greet you politly.
The Armour Smith: Choose a weapon to buy or Get Lost!
You: I'm not really sure what I want.
The Smith: Then get lost.
You: How much does that sword over there cost?
The Smith: 5 silver coins.
You: I don't have that kind of money.
The Smith: What kind of money do you have then?
You: I have 3 copper coins and a lady bug.
The Smith: Then Get Lost!
You: Okey, okey! Sheesh...
You: Okey, okey! Sheesh... I don't even have an inventory,
..but he's yelling at me, as if I'm a thief.
You leave him alone.
