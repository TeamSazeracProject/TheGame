You see an grown man, greeting you with a smiling face
Then he comes your way.
And he starts speaking about some curse..
And he starts speaking about some curse... and about some generations doing something...
And about some planets...
And about some planets... and an eclipse...
You don't really understand anything, but you nod your head every time.
You start to wonder when this will be over.
Guess what?
Guess what? It's not gonna be today.
...
You spend the whole day and the whole night, listening to the boring smart man.
Now you feel smart too, becouse you finally started understanding what he meant.
You say 'Goodbye' and start walking away
You say 'Goodbye' and start walking away, and as you turn your back on the men, you immidiatly forget everything he've told you so far.
You feel stupid again...
