You see a drinking man at 11 a'clock. He looks very poor.
The Drunk: Hi! Wanna drink some of my booze?
You: No, thank...s..glup,glup...
Before you had any time to respond, he simply emptyed his bottle in your throat.
It stings like hell.
At the next morning, you wake with a bad hangover 
..and you're not really sure what your second name was.
