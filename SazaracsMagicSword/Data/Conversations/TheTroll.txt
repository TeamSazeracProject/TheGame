You see a VERY rich man. He has gold all over himself.
But there's something else about him...
He's laughing at you!
He's laughing at you! He's a troll.
He's laughing at you! He's a troll. And there's nothing you can do about that.
The Troll: Hi! Wanna come in my House and rob me?
The Troll: But you can't can you?
The Troll: The developers were too lazy to permit you the option of entering a building.
The Troll: I have so much gold and valuables in my home. It's enough to but a small country.
The Troll: And you can't even touch it!
The Troll: Maaan, You Are So Lame!
The Troll: Lame, lame, lame.
You leave him alone and start crying like a little girl.
